ThaFrame is an intranet oriented PHP Framework, altought it can be used in
another scenarios, it had grown naturally around the necessities of intranets
because the main author had always made intranets with it and his previous
frameworks.

The design is centered around Page Patterns (Listings, Edit's, Forms, etc..)
that can be extended and of course you can make your own patterns.

This first public revision is highly unstable and isn't ready for mainstream use.
